A simple calculation which adds varies common C++ data types to determine the total size. It's useful when people are working on file IO or network IOs.

cd structCalculator
mkdir -p build
cd build

cmake ..
make

```
# To use it
Press the data type, and then use the NumPad to add the size (if it is an array). Default is 1. Then press enter.

It's not well tested yet, and it was only tested built on Ubuntu 18.04.
